# SDK Implementation Guide
<p>Follow the appropriate steps to complete. Based on the overall architecture diagram, the Merchant server is required to integrate with the below ConnectPay services exposed through First API (Fiserv's API gateway).</p>

## Overview 
<p>
ConnectPayAPI uses full payload encryption (not selective field, or field level encryption)

This is done with the intent to stop **Man In The Middle (MITM)** attacks.

Full payload encryption is achieved by encrypting the payload using Symmetric (AES) encryption with dynamically generated encryption key and Asymmetric (RSA) encryption for encrypting the Symmetric Keys.

**Why are both Symmetric and Asymmetric cryptography is required for full payload encryption?**

RSA encryption with 2048 bit keys have a limitation on the length of data that it can encrypt.The request / response payload for ConnectPay does not fit within that limit.

Hence, AES encryption is required to encrypt the request/response payloads.

The AES encryption uses a symmetric keys that should be shared between merchant and ConnectPay.

Having a static AES key is a bottleneck in the event of key compromise.

So on each call we expect a random AES key to be generated by the caller and used for encrypting the payload. Subsequently, the Symmetric key should be encrypted using the RSA public key and sent across along with the AES encrypted payload.
</p>

<p>

**How does this encryption model prevent MITM?**<

All request and response payload are encrypted and looks like gibberish to the person seeing it.

So even if an eves dropper succeeds to break TLS1.2 encryption in between sender (merchant) and receiver (ConnectPay backend app), all he would see is gibberish.

He would not be able to identify any fields passed or their values.

**What is the necessity of this encryption model for Server to Server secure communication?**

Server to server call is **relatively** secure than coming from an end users phone (which could be hacked).

In this context Server to Server communication is not via a leased line/dedicated channel, but, over public network/internet.
Server to server authentication is established using HMAC, however, that doesn’t prevent MITM attack.Any communication that happens over the public network/ internet is prone to attack and needs to be secured beyond just using TLS1.2 encryption. Hence full payload encryption is required for protecting merchant and consumer data.

## Pre-requisites
Below are the prerequisites before using ConnectPay's API's:

## Connectivity

The ConnectPay services are accessed through the public Internet. ConnectPay accepts communication only via the HTTPS channel. Custom HTTP headers are also used to carry additional information in each request.

|Environment                |Host                                     |Base Path  |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------|
|Certification API End Point|https://cat.api.firstdata.com/gateway/v2 |/connectpay|
|Production API End Point   |https://prod.api.firstdata.com/gateway/v2|/connectpay|

## Header Description
<p>
The header of each API call will contain several parameters. It is important that each parameter contain the specified values for a successful API call. Any changes to the values will be noted throughout the guide. 

Please follow the below link for all information related to headers</p>

[Headers,Decryption,Encryption](https://github.com/Fiserv/connect-pay/blob/develop/documentation/headersencryptiondecryption.md)

##  Step 1: Create Session Token

The Create Session Token API call is used to create a session token and to retrieve the RSA public key. This API is secured as it requires the Authorization header that can only be derived using the API Secret stored in the Merchant’s server. Below is more information on the SDK specification as well as example request and response payloads.

|Production API EndPoint| https://prod.api.firstdata.com/gateway/v2/connectpay/transactions/createsessiontoken|
|Http Method| POST|

For more examples and details on API please go to below Link: 
[API Explorer](https://qa-developer.fiserv.com/product/ConnectPay/api/?type=post&path=/security/createsessiontoken&branch=develop&version=1.0.0)

### Step 2: Create & Request Payload
At this step, all prerequisites have been complete in order to make our first call. First, the request payload must be created. The entire payload must be encrypted using different encryption methods. It must also be decrypted in order to decode the response payload into something that is readable. We will use the "Add Consumer Profile" as the example API. 

> Note: We will need to use the `tokenID` for the `Client-Token` header as well as the RSA `publicKey` in order to encrypt a portion of the payload before making the API call. Save these two pieces of information from the "Create Session Token" API used earlier in order to complete the call.

## Create Consumer Profile

The Create Consumer Profile call is mandatory for any new user enrollment using the ConnectPay SDK. This is used to create an `fdCustomerId` for a provided external id (and other user information) by the merchant. The returned fdCustomerId should be used right from the enrollment use case.

This API is secured, as it requires the Authorization header that can only be derived using the API Secret stored in the Merchant’s web server. Below are the details of the API end point.

>Please Note: Merchants who will be using Fiserv’s Universal Commerce (uCom) gateway should use “Create
Customer Profile API” from their uCom implementation guide.

## Get Connectpay Profile

<p>The Get CP Profile method is used to get consumer profile `fdCustomerID` and `externalID` using `fdCustomerID` or `externalID`
<br>
<p>Example :
<br>
Merchant X for some unforseen event loses the `fdCustomerId` for the corresponding `externalID` in their record.
<br>
In that scenario merchant can call this service to retrieve the `fdCustomerId` using the `externalID`.
<br>
Merchant does not send another create profile because its sure profile exists, just the data need to be retrieved.
<br>
This API is secured, as it requires the Authorization header that can only be derived using the API Secret stored in the Merchant’s web server. Below are the details of the API end point.
<br>
</p>

>Merchants who will be using Fiserv’s Universal Commerce (uCom) gateway should use “Create Customer Profile API” from their uCom implementation guide.

## Delete ConnectPay Profile
<p>The Delete ConnectPay Profile method is used to close consumer profile.
<br>
After this call is made you cannot re-activate the same profile.
<br>
An add profile request will need to be submitted.
<br>

This API is secured, as it requires the Authorization header that can only be derived using the API Secret stored in the Merchant’s web server. Below are the details of the API end point.</p>
<br>

> Please Note: Merchants who will be using Fiserv's Connected Commerce (uCom) gateway should use "Create Customer Profile API" from their Implementation Guide

> - - o Encryption/decryption logic fails on ConnectPayAPI(in this case encryption/decryption failed so not able to give back encrypted response).
<br>
In either case, the decrypted/unencrypted version of this payload has three high level transactionStatus , namely, APPROVED/DECLINED/ERROR.
</p>
<p>
**APPROVED** as the name suggests represents a successful outcome.
**DECLINED** status signifies that ConnectPayAPI rejected the request either due to format validation or business validation.
**ERROR** status signifies a system error or equivalent.

## Get Data
<p>
When the ConnectPayAPI provides a Nonce back to the Merchant during a use case, the Merchant in turn should be able to get the account details (new `fdAccountId`) of the consumer by securely using the provided nonce from their server.
<br>
In addition, the Merchant or SDK can retrieve the consumer information any time after the enrollment.
<br>
In either of the api calls, merchant have the option to retrieve the banking information in clear/masked. A merchant specific setting enables a merchant to retrieve the banking information either in clear or in mask as per business.
<br>
Use Case 1 (Nonce Get Data, Setting ON) – Merchant needs to get the account details (new `fdAccountId`) of the consumer in clear by providing the nonce generated at the time of enrollment. Refer [Example 1](Example 1)
<br>
Use Case 2 (Nonce Get Data, Setting OFF) – Merchant needs to get the account details (new `fdAccountId`) of the consumer in masked by providing the nonce generated at the time of enrollment. Refer [Example 1](Example 2)
<br>
Use Case 3 (Consumer Get Data, Setting ON) – Merchant needs to get the consumer information any time after enrollment and the account details of the consumer needs to be in clear. Refer [Example 1](Example 3)
<br>
Use Case 4 (Consumer Get Data, Setting OFF) – Merchant needs to get the consumer information any time after enrollment and the account details of the consumer needs to be in mask. Refer [Example 1](Example 4)

## Get Consumer Account Details
The Get Consumer Account Details API call is used to retrieve any account specific details required before calling a ConnectPay SDK Use Case.

For example when the end user wants to close the account, this API can be called by the Merchant Server to get the account number (linked to ACH) and can pass (the last 4 digits or masked) to the ConnectPay SDK. This will be shown as a read-only field to the user.

> Please Note: Merchants who will be using Fiserv’s Universal Commerce (uCom) gateway, should use "Customer Account Details API" from their Implementation guide.

}
```
Response Body may contain either componentDelta or componentFallBack elements.
<ol>
    <li>componentDelta: is encrypted ConnectPayAPI response</li>
    <li>componentFallBack : is unencrypted response and is only triggered in cases of ,Sessiontimeout(responsefromApigee) and Encryption decryptionlogicfailsonConnectPayAPI(inthiscaseencryption/decryption failed so not able to give back encrypted response).</li>
</ol>

### Make The Request
Using the correct endpoint, headers, and encrypted payload, we can then make the call. The ConnectPay backend will decrypt the payload and process the request. It will then return the response encrypted with the AES key and IV provided by componentX and componentY. An example of the output is shown below:
```json

}
```
## Get Consumer Account List
The Get Consumer Account List API call is used to retrieve all accounts associated with a consumer `fdCustomerId`.

This call can be beneficial in a scenario where you want to present the different payment options that are available and allow consumer to select any one of them for their transaction.

> Please Note: Merchants who will be using Fiserv’s Universal Commerce (uCom) gateway, should use "Customer Account List API" from their Implementation guide.

## Get Public Key
The Get Public Key API call is used to create a long lived public key for individual merchant and to retrieve the public encryption key which will be utilized to make calls for each transaction. This information will be vaulted in the merchant system and can be used to initialize the calls to ConnectPay directly from the merchant server without the involvement of SDK.

This API is secured as it requires the Authorization header that can only be derived using the API Secret stored in the Merchant’s web server. Below are the details of the API end point.

## ACH Authorize Transaction
Merchants who want to process ACH Transactions through FirstAPI must make server-to-server calls and pass the necessary encrypted payload as required for that particular case.

Use this to imitate an authorization request when the final transaction amount is not known. Unlike Debit, this will not put a hold on consumer’s funds in their account. If request is approved use the Capture request to send final transaction amount.

> Please Note: Merchants who will be using Fiserv’s Universal Commerce (uCom) gateway, Fiserv Buypass, or Rapid Connect gateway platform should use respective implementation guides for sending Transactions.

## ACH Collection Fee Notification Transaction
Merchants who want to process ACH Transactions through FirstAPI must make server-to-server calls and the pass necessary encrypted payload as required for that particular case.

Per Reg E requirements, this service is required for in-person, point of sale transaction use cases to display applicable state collection fee and cost to the consumer prior to transacting. For other payment uses cases (i.e. online transactions) this service is not needed, rather a link to our collection fee and cost table is displayed in the checkout page. Please refer to the Legal and Compliance section in the ConnectPay Merchant Guide. <!--Where is this guide?-->

> Please Note: Merchants who will be using Fiserv’s Universal Commerce (uCom) gateway, Fiserv Buypass, or Rapid Connect gateway platform should use respective implementation guides for sending Transactions.
