# ACH Transaction Architecture
Depending on merchant setup, ACH Transactions can be sent to ConnectPay using Universal Commerce (uCom), Buypass or through ConnectPayPayment through FirstAPI.

<li>[Buypass](https://qa-developer.fiserv.com/product/)</li>
</ol>

## Explanation of Feature
All payments are server-to-server communication between the merchant server and FirstAPI. Transactions can be initiated using `fdAccountId` or, connectPayPaymentNumber

</p>

### Additional Steps
<ol>
  <li>Merchant server makes server to server call to ConnectPay at FirstAPI and sends encrypted ACH Transaction Payload</li>
  <li>ConnectPay at FirstAPI responds back with encrypted response payload</li>
  <li>Merchant server decrypts response payload and takes action accordingly</li>
